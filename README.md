1. A brief Conſideration of ſome Principles
upon which the Armies late PLEA
is grounded.

    _ Principle The firſt.THat the principal End of publick Government
(next unto the glory of God) is the protection and
preſervation of all good men, in their peaceable
and quiet living in all godlineſs and honeſty.

    _ The ſecond.That the Magiſtrates duty in all forms of Government
whatſoever, is to defend all good men from all injuries while
they ſo live.

    _ The third.That the belief and perſwaſion of the former principle, is
a Light that hath ſhined into the minds and judgments of many
ſober and diſcreet men.

    _ The fourth.That the peoples ſafety is the chief Soveraignty.

    _ The fifth.That Kings, and all that are in Authority, are Gods Miniſters
for his peoples good.

    _ The ſixth.That Governours were made for the people, and not the
people for them.

    _ The ſeventhThat they (to wit, Kings and Governours) have no power
and authority, but what (under God) they have from the people,
and for their uſe.

    _ The eighth.That uncontrolable power and abſolute authority do become
none but only Him, whoſe nature is perfect, and can do no
wrong.

    _ The ninth.That though Supreme Magiſtrates be above every individual,
yet are they beneath, and inferior unto the whole.

    _ The tenth.That the Eſſential End of all Kings, Rulers, Lawes and
Governments is the Common peace, juſtice, and ſafety of the
people.

    _ The eleventh
That no Governours or Governments are to be continued
and tolerated which are directly and plainly deſtructive unto
the chief end of their Original appointment, viz. Common
Good.
The twelfthThat the power and diſpoſition of the publick Militia, and of the

publick Treaſury, were
    _ Thh 13th.That whatſoever Laws, Uſage, or Cuſtoms are againſt the
Laws of true Religion, Reaſon, Nature and Grace, are irreligious,
unreaſonable, unnatural and graceleſse; and therefore
Nul and void in their very making, and cannot oblige.

    _ The 14th.That when thoſe in Authority ſhall neglect the great Ends of
Government, and improve all opportunities and advantages by
means of their Power and Grandure, unto their own Perſonal
and Family intereſt; eſpecially when they ſhall wilfully, and againſt
common and univerſal reaſon, act contrary thereunto, to
the apparent danger of common ſafety, they determine their
Authority; and having in ſuch caſes quitted their care and
reſpects to the peoples protection and welfare, they likewiſe quit
the people from their allegiance and obedience.

    _ The 15th.That as all Lawes, Statutes, Acts and Ordinances, ſo all
Engagements, Promiſes, and Proteſtations, all Acknowledgements,
Subſcriptions, Vowes and Oaths, all, and all manner
of Obligations and Expreſſions thereof, are only binding unto
the Publick Safety, and not at all to the Perſons of the Governours,
or formes of Government, but with reference thereunto.
